# Phix
Phix is intended to serve as a personal assistant and chatbot. 

### Architecture:
It is built off of the [speech_recognition](https://github.com/Uberi/speech_recognition) Python library and uses the Google Speech Recognigtion API. 

In terms of use, Phix takes inspiration from PA's like Siri (Apple) or Alexa (Amazon). It searches for hardcoded keywords in user speech and then executes the corresponding function.

### Development:
In the future, Phix will likely be adapted to a personal and unique LSTM recognition model to limit external dependencies and eliminate the need for an internet connection. 
In terms of keyword features, development is ongoing with suggestions welcome and wanted. 
Work to integrate its assistant features with a more natural 'chat' interface is still in development. 

#### Project start date: 
21 May 2019 
#### Projected end date: 
8 August 2019
